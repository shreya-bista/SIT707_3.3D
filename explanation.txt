In the provided code, we have three main classes: `DateUtil`, `Meeting`, and `MeetingScheduler`. Here's how they interact with each other:

1. **DateUtil**:
   - `DateUtil` is a utility class for handling date-related operations.
   - It encapsulates functionality for creating, manipulating, and validating dates.
   - It provides methods for incrementing and decrementing dates, checking month durations, and converting dates to strings.
   - `DateUtil` serves as the backbone for handling dates in our application.

2. **Meeting**:
   - `Meeting` represents a scheduled meeting, including the date and description of the meeting.
   - Each `Meeting` object contains a `DateUtil` instance representing the date of the meeting.
   - It encapsulates the information related to a specific meeting instance, such as its date and description.
   - `Meeting` relies on `DateUtil` to handle date-related operations and ensure consistency and validity of the meeting dates.

3. **MeetingScheduler**:
   - `MeetingScheduler` is responsible for managing scheduled meetings.
   - It maintains a list of `Meeting` objects to keep track of scheduled meetings.
   - The `scheduleMeeting` method allows scheduling a new meeting by providing a `DateUtil` object representing the meeting date and a description.
   - The `postponeMeeting` method allows postponing a meeting to a new date by providing the original date and the new date as `DateUtil` objects.
   - `MeetingScheduler` interacts closely with `DateUtil` to validate dates, check for conflicts, and update meeting schedules accordingly.

**Interactions:**
- When scheduling a meeting (`scheduleMeeting`), `MeetingScheduler` creates a new `Meeting` object, which includes a `DateUtil` instance representing the meeting date. This ensures that the scheduled date is valid and consistent.
- When postponing a meeting (`postponeMeeting`), `MeetingScheduler` updates the date of the corresponding `Meeting` object using `DateUtil`. It leverages `DateUtil`'s methods for date validation and manipulation to ensure the correctness of the new meeting date.

In summary, `DateUtil`, `Meeting`, and `MeetingScheduler` work together to facilitate the management of meetings, ensuring that dates are handled accurately and consistently throughout the application.
